## Smart Home Automation using Sensors

**Description of the Project:**
The project "Smart Home Automation using Sensors" involves the integration of various sensors with a microcontroller board to enhance home security and automation. The system includes a Smoke Detector, PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor. These sensors automate different home functions, improving safety and convenience.

### Objectives
- To develop a smart home system that enhances safety and convenience.
- To automate home functionalities using sensor data.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for manual control where needed.

### Key Activities
1. **Smoke Detection:** 
   - Sensing gas leakage using the Smoke Detector.
   - Activating an alarm circuit upon detection of gas leakage.
   
2. **Automatic Door Control:**
   - Using the Ultrasonic sensor to automatically open the front door when someone is detected in front of it.
   
3. **Human Detection and Fan Control:**
   - Utilizing the PIR sensor to detect human presence.
   - Turning ON the fan when a human is detected and allowing manual control for user convenience.
   
4. **Automatic Light Control:**
   - Employing the LDR sensor to manage home lighting.
   - Turning ON the lights automatically at night when someone is home and turning them OFF during the day.

### Technology Used
- **Microcontroller Board:** Central unit connecting and processing data from all sensors.
- **Smoke Detector:** For gas leakage detection.
- **PIR Sensor:** For human detection.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** For automatic door control.
- **LDR Sensor:** For automatic light control.
- **Alarm Circuit:** For alerting in case of gas leakage.

### Working
The system operates by continuously monitoring sensor data. The Smoke Detector senses gas leakage and triggers the alarm. The Ultrasonic sensor detects proximity at the door, opening it automatically when someone is nearby. The PIR sensor identifies human presence, turning on the fan as needed, while also allowing manual operation. The LDR sensor controls lighting based on ambient light levels, ensuring lights are on at night when someone is home and off during the day.

### Conclusion
The "Smart Home Automation using Sensors" project demonstrates an efficient way to enhance home safety and automation. By leveraging various sensors and a microcontroller, the system provides automatic control over key home functions, improving security and convenience for users.
